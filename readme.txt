To install the asset pack:

1. Access your steam library, and right click on Team Fortress 2, then click "Properties"
2. On the left side menu, click on "Local Files" and click "Browse..."
3. This will take you to your Team Fortress 2 folder on Windows Explorer (if you are using Windows)
4. Double click on the folder named "tf", then "custom"
5. After following this step, your current file path should be 

	"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom" 
	Depending on where Steam is installed

6. Drag the HHAssets folder into custom as depicted in the included gif
7. You're done!

If you prefer to install the custom assets into your downloads folder, 
you can move maps, materials, models, scripts, and sounds into tf/downloads.

Enjoy playing Hexadecimal Horrors!
